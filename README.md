### Abstract

This essay reflects on my first experience of the Notting Hill Carnival, attended on Monday 25 August. What struck me was not merely the spectacle of feathers, music, and crowds, but the deeper significance: Carnival allows those who are usually invisible in Britain—black and brown communities, women, the marginalised—to take centre stage, if only briefly. Through its history of resistance, its inversion of racial and gender hierarchies, and its joyous assertion of belonging, Carnival demonstrates how visibility itself becomes political. It is a moment sanctioned by the state yet claimed by the community, where the margins become the centre, and where an alternative vision of Britain—plural, imperfect, but alive—can be glimpsed.
